# Happiness 

In the project, we will take the role of a consultant at the United Nations to analyze the happiness of living in each country. Precisely, my interests are determining factors correlated to peopleâ€™s happiness in selected countries and optimizing generalized linear models (GAMs) with the model selection technique. Compared to the problem-solution paper and the data visualization paper, the project requires professional knowledge in the statistics field. Therefore, the primary audiences for the project are professions and data analysts.
